# Ransomware-Project
This is the project I created during my Cybersecurity Mentorship with LEAP

This software isnt 100% finished as the scope of the scrape is too broad (looking for money amounts, companies, etc. where they may not be relevant), but I will surely
add more to it in the future.


This code scrapes various news sites for information related to ransomware attacks, then plots those data points using MatPlotLib.


My code is listed in the Ransomware-Project/Ransomware Project/ransom_scrape/ransom_scrape/spiders/ Directory.

the two ransom_scrape files are for scrappy configurations. 


Used libraries and Frameworks:
Pandas,
Beautiful Soup,
Scrapy,
MatPlotLib
